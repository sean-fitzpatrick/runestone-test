<p>The focus on proofs may be one place where your second course in linear algebra differs from your first. Learning to write proofs (and to know when a proof you have written is valid) is a difficult skill that takes time to develop. Some of the proofs in this section are “clever”, in the sense that they require you to apply vector space axioms in ways that may not seem obvious. Proofs in later sections will more often be more straightforward “direct” proofs of conditional (if … then) statements, although they may not feel straightforward on your first encounter.</p>
