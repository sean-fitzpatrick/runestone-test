<p>Since the notes were written for a course that used Nicholson's textbook, the influence of his book is evident throughout. In particular, much of the notation agrees with that of Nicholson, and there are places where I refer to his book for further details. I taught a previous offering of this course using Sheldon Axler's beautiful <em class="emphasis">Linear Algebra Done Right</em>, which certainly had an effect on how I view the subject, and it is quite likely that this has impacted how I present some of the material in this book.</p>
