<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be a finite-dimensional, non-trivial vector space. If <span class="process-math">\(\vv\neq \zer\)</span> is a vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv\}\)</span> is linearly independent. By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lem-enlarge-independent.html" title="Lemma 1.7.12">Lemma 1.7.12</a>, we can enlarge this set to a basis of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> has a basis.</p>
<p>Now, suppose <span class="process-math">\(V = \spn\{\ww_1,\ldots, \ww_m\}\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(B=\{\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_n\}\)</span> be a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> By definition, we have <span class="process-math">\(\dim V=n\text{,}\)</span> and by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-steinitz.html" title="Theorem 1.7.1: Fundamental Theorem (Steinitz Exchange Lemma)">Theorem 1.7.1</a>, since <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is linearly independent, we must have <span class="process-math">\(n\leq m\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Let us now consider an independent set <span class="process-math">\(I=\{\uu_1,\ldots, \uu_k\}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is independent and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(k\leq n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\spn I\neq V\text{,}\)</span> there must be some element of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> that is not in the span of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{:}\)</span> if every element of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(\spn I\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\spn I = \spn (B\cup I)\)</span> by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-surplus-span.html" title="Theorem 1.4.8">Theorem 1.4.8</a>. And since <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is a basis, it spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> so every element of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is in the span of <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and we similarly have that <span class="process-math">\(\spn (B\cup I)=\spn B\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\spn B=\spn I\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since we can find an element of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> that is not in the span of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> we can add that element to <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> and the resulting set is still independent. If the new set spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we're done. If not, we can repeat the process, adding another vector from <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Since the set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is finite, this process must eventually end.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dimension.html#proof-17" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
