<p>We need to first recall that the span of a set of vectors is, first and foremost, a set. That means that we are proving the equality of two sets. Recall that this typically requires us to prove that each set is a subset of the other.</p>
<p>This means that we need to show that any linear combination of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\uu,\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_k\)</span> can be written as a linear combination of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_k\text{,}\)</span> and vice-versa. In one direction, we will need our hypothesis: <span class="process-math">\(\uu\in \spn\{\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_k\}\text{.}\)</span> In the other direction, we come back to a trick we've already seen: adding zero does nothing. That is, if a vector is missing from a linear combination, we can include it, using <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> for its coefficient.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-span.html#proof-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
