<p>For the case of a matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(T_A:\R^n\to \R^m\text{,}\)</span> notice that <span class="process-math">\(\ker T_A\)</span> is simply the set of all solutions to <span class="process-math">\(A\xx=\zer\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\(\im T_A\)</span> is the set of all <span class="process-math">\(\yy\in\R^m\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(A\xx=\yy\)</span> <em class="emphasis">has</em> a solution.</p>
<p>Recall from the discussion preceding <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-rank-transformation.html" title="Definition 2.2.9">Definition 2.2.9</a> that <span class="process-math">\(\rank A = \dim \csp(A) = \dim \im T_A\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> is surjective if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\rank A = m\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> is injective if and only if <span class="process-math">\(\rank A = n\text{,}\)</span> because we know that the system <span class="process-math">\(A\xx=\zer\)</span> has a unique solution if and only if each column of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> contains a leading one.</p>
<p>This has some interesting consequences. If <span class="process-math">\(m=n\)</span> (that is, if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is square), then each increase in <span class="process-math">\(\dim \nll(A)\)</span> produces a corresponding decrease in <span class="process-math">\(\dim \csp(A)\text{,}\)</span> since both correspond to the “loss” of a leading one. Moreover, if <span class="process-math">\(\rank A = n\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> is both injective and surjective. Recall that a function is invertible if and only if it is both injective and surjective. It should come as no surprise that invertibility of <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> (as a function) is equivalent to invertibility of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> (as a matrix).</p>
<p>Also, note that if <span class="process-math">\(m \lt n\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\rank A\leq m \lt n\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> could be surjective, but can't possibly be injective. On the other hand, if <span class="process-math">\(m\gt n\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\rank A\leq n \lt m\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(T_A\)</span> could be injective, but can't possibly be surjective. These results generalize to linear transformations between any finite-dimensional vector spaces. The first step towards this is the following theorem, which is sometimes known as the Fundamental Theorem of Linear Transformations.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-kernel-image.html#remark-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
