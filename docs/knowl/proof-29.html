<p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W = \{\zer\}\text{,}\)</span> and suppose that we have <span class="process-math">\(\vv = \uu_1+\ww_1 = \uu_2+\ww_2\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\uu_1,\uu_2\in U,\ww_1,\ww_2\in W\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\zer=(\uu_1-\uu_2)+(\ww_1-\ww_2)\text{,}\)</span> which implies that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\ww_1-\ww_2 = -(\uu_1-\uu_2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Now, <span class="process-math">\(\uu=\uu_1-\uu_2\in U\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a subspace, and similarly, <span class="process-math">\(\ww=\ww_1-\ww_2\in W\text{.}\)</span> But we also have <span class="process-math">\(\ww=-\uu\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\ww\in U\text{.}\)</span> (Since <span class="process-math">\(-\uu\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> and this is the same vector as <span class="process-math">\(\ww\text{.}\)</span>) Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\ww\in U\cap W\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\ww=\zer\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\ww_1=\ww_2\text{.}\)</span> But we must also then have <span class="process-math">\(\uu=\zer\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(\uu_1=\uu_2\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Conversely, suppose that every <span class="process-math">\(\vv\in U+W\)</span> can be written uniquely as <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\vec{u}+\ww\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\uu\in U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ww\in W\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\in U\cap W\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\in U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\in W\text{,}\)</span> so we also have <span class="process-math">\(-\mathbf{a}\in W\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is a subspace. But then <span class="process-math">\(\zer=\mathbf{a}+(-\mathbf{a})\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\in U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-\mathbf{a}\in W\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(\zer=\zer+\zer\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\zer\)</span> belongs to both <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}=\zer\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span> was arbitrary, <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W = \{\zer\}\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-subspace-combine.html#proof-29" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
