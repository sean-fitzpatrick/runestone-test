<p>Linear algebra, as an abstract mathematical topic, begins with a realization of the importance of these properties. Indeed, these properties, established as theorems for vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> become the <em class="emphasis">axioms</em> for the abstract notion of a <em class="emphasis">vector space</em>. The advantage of abstracting these ideas is that any proofs we write that depend only on these axioms will automatically be valid for any set of objects satisfying those axioms. That is, a result that is true for vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is often also true for vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> and for matrices, and polynomials, and so on. Mathematicians like to be efficient, and prefer to establish a result once in an abstract setting, knowing that it will then apply to many concrete settings that fit into the framework of the abstract result.</p>
