<p>On your first assignment, you showed that if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> are subspaces of a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> then the intersection <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W\)</span> is also a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> You also showed that the union <span class="process-math">\(U\cup W\)</span> is generally not a subspace, unless one subspace is contained in the other (in which case the union is just the larger of the two subspaces we already have).</p>
<p>In class, we discussed the fact that the right way to define a subspace containing both <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> is using their <dfn class="terminology">sum</dfn>: we define the sum <span class="process-math">\(U+W\)</span> of two subspaces by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
U+W = \{\uu+\ww \,|\, \uu\in U \text{ and } \ww\in W\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We proved that <span class="process-math">\(U+W\)</span> is again a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W = \{\mathbf{0}\}\text{,}\)</span> we say that the sum is a <dfn class="terminology">direct sum</dfn>, and write it as <span class="process-math">\(U\oplus W\text{.}\)</span> The following theorem might help us understand why direct sums are singled out for special attention:</p>

<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> be subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(U+W\)</span> is finite-dimensional, and</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\dim(U+W)=\dim U + \dim W - \dim(U\cap W)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div></article><p>If the sum is direct, then we have simply <span class="process-math">\(\dim(U\oplus W) = \dim U + \dim W\text{.}\)</span> The other reason why direct sums are preferable, is that any <span class="process-math">\(\vv\in U\oplus W\)</span> can be written <em class="emphasis">uniquely</em> as <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\uu+\ww\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\uu\in U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ww\in W\text{.}\)</span></p>

As we continue on to later topics, we'll find that it is often useful to be able to decompose a vector space into a direct sum of subspaces. Using bases, we can show that this is always possible.</p>
