<article class="hiddenproof"><h3 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof</span></h3>
<p>The trick with this proof is that we aren't assuming <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is finite-dimensional, so we can't start with a basis of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> But we do know that <span class="process-math">\(\im T\)</span> is finite-dimensional, so we start with a basis <span class="process-math">\(\{\ww_1,\ldots, \ww_m\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\im T\text{.}\)</span> Of course, every vector in <span class="process-math">\(\im T\)</span> is the image of some vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> so we can write <span class="process-math">\(\ww_i =T(\vv_i)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vv_i\in V\text{,}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(i=1,2,\ldots, m\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(\{T(\vv_1),\ldots, T(\vv_m)\}\)</span> is a basis, it is linearly independent. The results of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_lintrans-indep.html" title="Exercise 2.1.13">ExerciseÂ 2.1.13</a> tell us that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_m\}\)</span> must therefore be independent.</p>
<p>We now introduce a basis <span class="process-math">\(\{\uu_1,\ldots, \uu_n\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\ker T\text{,}\)</span> which we also know to be finite-dimensional. If we can show that the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\uu_1,\ldots, \uu_n,\vv_1,\ldots, \vv_m\}\)</span> is a basis for <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we'd be done, since the number of vectors in this basis is <span class="process-math">\(\dim\ker T + \dim \im T\text{.}\)</span> We must therefore show that this set is independent, and that it spans <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>To see that it's independent, suppose that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a_1\uu_1+\cdots + a_n\uu_n+b_1\vv_1+\cdots +b_m\vv_m=\zer\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Applying <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to this equation, and noting that <span class="process-math">\(T(\uu_i)=\zer\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> by definition of the <span class="process-math">\(\uu_i\text{,}\)</span> we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
b_1T(\vv_1)+\cdots +b_mT(\vv_m)=\zer\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We assumed that the vectors <span class="process-math">\(T(\vv_i)\)</span> were independent, so all the <span class="process-math">\(b_i\)</span> must be zero. But then we get</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
a_1\uu_1+\cdots +a_n\uu_n=\zer\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and since the <span class="process-math">\(\uu_i\)</span> are independent, all the <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> must be zero.</p>
<p>To see that these vectors span, choose any <span class="process-math">\(\xx\in V\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(T(\xx)\in \im T\text{,}\)</span> there exist scalars <span class="process-math">\(c_1,\ldots, c_m\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
T(\xx)=c_1T(\vv_1)+\cdots +c_mT(\vv_m)\text{.}\tag{2.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">We'd like to be able to conclude from this that <span class="process-math">\(\xx=c_1\vv_1+\cdots +c_m\vv_m\text{,}\)</span> but this would be false, unless <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> was known to be injective (which it isn't). Failure to be injective involves the kernel -- how do we bring that into the picture?</p>
<p>The trick is to realize that the reason we might have <span class="process-math">\(\xx\neq c_1\vv_1+\cdots +c_m\vv_m\)</span> is that we're off by something in the kernel. Indeed, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eqn-almost-span.html" title="Equation 2.2.1">(2.2.1)</a> can be re-written as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-almost-span.html">
\begin{equation*}
T(\xx-c_1\vv_1-\cdots -c_m\vv_m) = \zer\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so <span class="process-math">\(\xx-c_1\vv_1-\cdots -c_m\vv_m\in\ker T\text{.}\)</span> But we have a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\ker T\text{,}\)</span> so we can write</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-almost-span.html">
\begin{equation*}
\xx-c_1\vv_1-\cdots -c_m\vv_m=t_1\uu_1+\cdots +t_n\uu_n
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">for some scalars <span class="process-math">\(t_1,\ldots, t_n\text{,}\)</span> and this can be rearanged to give</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eqn-almost-span.html">
\begin{equation*}
\xx=t_1\uu_1+\cdots +t_n\uu_n+c_1\vv_1+\cdots + c_m\vv_m\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which completes the proof.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-kernel-image.html#proof-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
