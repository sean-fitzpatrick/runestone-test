<p>The clue here that this is not a subspace is the presence of the 2 in the second component. Typically for a subspace, we expect to see linear expressions involving our variables, but in linear algebra, the adjective <em class="emphasis">linear</em> doesn't imply the inclusion of constant terms the way it does in calculus. The reason, again, is the special role of zero in a vector space.</p>
<p>While it's true that this set doesn't contain the zero vector (which rules it out as a subspace), it's not as obvious: perhaps there are values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that give us <span class="process-math">\(x+y+2=0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x-y=0, 2x-3y=0\)</span> as well? Solving a system of equations would tell us that indeed, this is not possible.</p>
<p>We could also show that the closure conditions fail. Putting <span class="process-math">\(x=1, y=0\)</span> gives the element <span class="process-math">\((1,3,2)\text{,}\)</span> and putting <span class="process-math">\(x=0,y=1\)</span> gives the element <span class="process-math">\((-1,3,-3)\text{.}\)</span> Adding these, we get the vector <span class="process-math">\((0,6,-1)\text{.}\)</span> Why is this not in the set? We would need <span class="process-math">\(x-y=0\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x=y\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x+y+2=2x+2=6\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(x=y=2\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(2(2)-3(2)=-2\neq -3\text{.}\)</span></p>
