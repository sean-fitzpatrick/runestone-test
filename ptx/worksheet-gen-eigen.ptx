    <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>V</m> be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let <m>T:V\to V</m> be a linear operator.
      Assume that <m>T</m> has all real eigenvalues (alternatively, assume we're working over the complex numbers).
      Let <m>A</m> be the matrix of <m>T</m> with respect to some standard basis <m>B_0</m> of <m>V</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal will be to replace the basis <m>B_0</m> with a basis <m>B</m> such that the matrix of <m>T</m> with respect to <m>B</m> is as simple as possible.
      (Where we agree that the "simplest" possible matrix would be diagonal.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall the following results that we've observed so far:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The characteristic polynomial <m>c_T(x)</m> of <m>T</m> does not depend on the choice of basis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The eigenvalues of <m>T</m> are the roots of this polynomial.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The eigenspaces <m>E_\lambda(T)</m> are <m>T</m>-invariant subspaces of <m>V</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The matrix <m>A</m> can be diagonalized if and only if there is a basis of <m>V</m> consisting of eigenvectors of <m>T</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose
            <me>
              c_T(x) = (x-\lambda_1)^{m_1}(x-\lambda_2)^{m_2}\cdots (x-\lambda_k)^{m_k}
            </me>.
            Then <m>A</m> can be diagonalized if and only if <m>\dim E_{\lambda_i}(T) = m_i</m> for each <m>i=1,\ldots, k</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
     </p>

      <p>
        In the case where <m>A</m> can be diagonalized, we have the direct sum decomposition
        <me>
          V = E_{\lambda_1}(T)\oplus E_{\lambda_2}(T) \oplus \cdots \oplus E_{\lambda_k}(T)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question is: what do we do if there aren't enough eigenvectors to form a basis of <m>V</m>?
        When that happens, the direct sum of all the eigenspaces will not give us all of <m>V</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea: replace <m>E_{\lambda_j}(T)</m> with a <term>generalized eigenspace</term>
        <m>G_{\lambda_j}(T)</m> whose dimension is <m>m_i</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our candidate: instead of <m>E_{\lambda}(T) = \ker(T-\lambda I)</m>,
        we use <m>G_\lambda(T) = \ker((T-\lambda I)^m)</m>, where <m>m</m> is the multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>.

        <p>
          Recall that in class we proved that <m>\ker(T)</m> and <m>\operatorname{im}(T)</m> are <m>T</m>-invariant subspaces.
          Let <m>p(x)</m> be any polynomial, and prove that <m>\ker (p(T))</m> and <m>\operatorname{im}(p(T))</m> are also <m>T</m>-invariant.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Hint:</em> first show that <m>p(T)T=Tp(T)</m> for any polynomial <m>T</m>.

    <sage language="html"></sage>

    <p>
      Applying the result of Problem 1 to the polynomial <m>p(x) = (x-\lambda)^m</m> shows that <m>G_\lambda(T)</m> is <m>T</m>-invariant.
      It is possible to show that <m>\dim G_\lambda(T)=m</m> but I won't ask you to do that. (A proof is in Nicholson if you really want to see it.)

    <p>
      Instead, we will try to understand what's going on by exploring an example.

      Consider the following matrix.

      It turns out that at some point, the null spaces stabilize.
      If <m>\operatorname{null}(A^k)=\operatorname{null}A^{k+1}</m> for some <m>k</m>,
      then <m>\operatorname{null}(A^k)=\operatorname{null}(A^{k+l})</m> for all <m>l\geq 0</m>.

          For each eigenvalue found in <xref ref="ws-ge-ex2"/>, compute the nullspace of <m>A-\lambda I</m>,
          <m>(A-\lambda I)^2</m>, <m>(A-\lambda I)^3</m>, <etc/> until you find two consecutive nullspaces that are the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          By <xref ref="ws-ge-ex4"/>, any vector in <m>\operatorname{null}(A-\lambda I)^m</m> will also be a vector in <m>\operatorname{null}(A-\lambda I)^{m+1}</m>.
          In particular, at each step, we can find a basis for <m>\operatorname{null}(A-\lambda I)^m</m> that includes the basis for <m>\operatorname{null}(A-\lambda I)^{m-1}</m>.

        <p>
          For each eigenvalue found in <xref ref="ws-ge-ex2"/>, determine such a basis for the corresponding generalized eigenspace.
          You will want to list your vectors so that the vectors from the basis of the nullspace for <m>A-\lambda I</m> come first,
          then the vectors for the basis of the nullspace for <m>(A-\lambda I)^2</m>, and so on.

          Finally, let's see how all of this works. Let <m>P</m> be the matrix whose columns consist of the vectors found in Problem 4.
