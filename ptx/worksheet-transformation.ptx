  <title>Worksheet: matrix transformations</title>
  <page>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        This worksheet deals with matrix transformations, and in particular,
        kernel and image.
        The goal is to understand these important subspaces in a familiar context.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an <m>m\times n</m> matrix.
        We can use <m>A</m> to define a transformation <m>T_A:\R^n\to \R^m</m>
        given by <m>T_A(\xx)=A\xx</m>, where we view <m>\xx</m>
        as an <m>n\times 1</m> column vector.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <term>kernel</term> of <m>T_A</m> is the set of vectors <m>\xx</m>
        such that <m>T_A(\xx)=\zer</m>.
        That is, <m>\ker T_A</m> is the set of solutions to the homogeneous system <m>A\xx = \zer</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <term>image</term> of <m>T_A</m> (also known as the range of <m>T_A</m>)
        is the set of vectors <m>\yy\in \R^m</m> such that <m>\yy = A\xx</m>
        for some <m>\xx\in\R^n</m>.
        In other words, <m>\im(T_A)</m> is the set of vectors <m>\yy</m>
        for which the non-homogeneous system <m>A\xx=\yy</m> is consistent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because <m>T_A</m> is a linear transformation,
        we can compute it as long as we're given its values on a basis.
        If <m>\{\vv_1, \vv_2,\ldots, \vv_n\}</m> is a basis for <m>\R^n</m>,
        then for any <m>\xx\in\R^n</m> there exist unique scalars <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots, c_n</m>
        such that
        <me>
          \xx = c_1\vv_1+c_2\vv_2+\cdots + c_n\vv_n
        </me>,
        and since <m>T_A</m> is linear, we have
        <me>
          T_A(\xx)=c_1T_A(\vv_1)+c_2T_A(\vv_2)+\cdots +c_nT_A(\vv_n)
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main challenge, computationally speaking, is that if our basis is not the standard basis,
        some effort will be required to write <m>\xx</m> in terms of the given basis.
      </p>

    <exercise workspace="3in">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Confirm that
          <me>
            B=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\2\\3\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}4\\2\\0\\-3\end{bmatrix},

          is a basis for <m>\R^4</m>.

      </statement>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      To assist with solving this problem, a code cell is provided below.
      Recall that you can enter the matrix <m>\begin{bmatrix}a\amp b\amp c\\d\amp e\amp f\\g\amp h\amp i\end{bmatrix}</m>
      as <c>Matrix([[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]])</c> or as <c>Matrix(3,3,[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i])</c>.
    </p>
  </page>

  <page>
    <p>
      The reduced row-echeleon form of <c>A</c> is given by <c>A.rref()</c>.
      The product of matrices <c>A</c> and <c>B</c> is simply <c>A*B</c>.
      The inverse of a matrix <c>A</c> can be found using <c>A.inv()</c> or simply <c>A**(-1)</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One note of caution: in the <init>HTML</init> worksheet,
      if you don't import <c>sympy</c> as your first line of code,
      you'll instead use Sage syntax. Sage uses <c>A.inverse()</c> instead of <c>A.inv()</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a Jupyter notebook, remember you can generate additional code cells by clicking on the <c>+</c> button.

      A linear transformation <m>T:\R^4\to \R^4</m> is now defined as follows:
      <me>
        T\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\2\\3\end{bmatrix}\right)=\begin{bmatrix}3\\0\\2\\-1\end{bmatrix},
        T\left(\begin{bmatrix}4\\2\\0\\-3\end{bmatrix}\right)=\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\0\\5\end{bmatrix},

          Let <m>M</m> be the matrix whose columns are given by the values of <m>T</m> on the basis <m>B</m>.
          (This would be the matrix of <m>T</m> if <m>B</m> was actually the standard basis.)

      Next we will compute the kernel and image of the transformation from the previous exercises.
      Recall that when solving a homogeneous system <m>A\xx = \zer</m>,
      we find the <init>RREF</init> of <m>A</m>,
      and any variables whose columns do not contain a leading 1 are assigned as parameters.
      We then express the general solution <m>x</m> in terms of those parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      The image of a matrix transformation <m>T_A</m> is also known as the <term>column space</term>
      of <m>A</m>, because the range of <m>T_A</m> is precisely the span of the columns of <m>A</m>.
      The <init>RREF</init> of <m>A</m> tells us which columns to keep:
      the columns of <m>A</m> that correspond to the columns in the <init>RREF</init> of <m>A</m> with a leading 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <m>T</m> be the linear transformation given in the previous exercises.

          The <term>Dimension Theorem</term> states that for a linear transformation
          <m>T:V\to W</m>, where <m>V</m> is finite-dimensional,
          <me>
            \dim V = \dim\ker(T)+ \dim\im(T)
