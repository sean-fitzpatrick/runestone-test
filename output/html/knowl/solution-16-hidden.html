<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>Here, we have the condition <span class="process-math">\(\det(A)=0\text{,}\)</span> which is homogeneous, but is it linear? If you remember a bit about the determinant, you might recall that it behaves well with respect to multiplication, but not addition, and indeed, this is going to mean that we don't have a subspace.</p>
<p>To see that this is the case, consider closure under addition. The matrices <span class="process-math">\(A=\bbm 1\amp 0\\0\amp 0\ebm\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B=\bbm 0\amp 0\\0\amp 1\ebm\)</span> both have determinant <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(A+B=\bbm 1\amp 0\\0\amp 1\ebm\)</span> has determinant 1. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> both belong to the set, but <span class="process-math">\(A+B\)</span> does not.</p>
