<p>Hermitian and unitary matrices (or more accurately, linear operators) are very important in quantum mechanics. Indeed, hermitian matrices represent “observable” quantities, in part because their eigenvalues are real, as we'll soon see. For us, hermitian and unitary matrices can simply be viewed as the complex counterparts of symmetric and orthogonal matrices, respectively. In fact, a real symmetric matrix <em class="emphasis">is</em> hermitian, since the conjugate has no effect on it, and similarly, a real orthogonal matrix is technically unitary. As with orthogonal matrices, a unitary matrix can also be characterized by the property that its rows and columns both form orthonormal bases.</p>
