<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>This time, we will outline the strategy, and leave the execution to you. Both parts are about linear combinations. What does independence look like for a single vector? We would need to show that if <span class="process-math">\(c\vv=\zer\)</span> for some scalar <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(c=0\text{.}\)</span> Now recall that in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-zero-mult-prop.html" title="Exercise 1.2.4">ExerciseÂ 1.2.4</a>, we showed that if <span class="process-math">\(c\vv=\zer\text{,}\)</span> either <span class="process-math">\(c=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\zer\text{.}\)</span> We're assuming <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\zer\text{,}\)</span> so what does that tell you about <span class="process-math">\(c\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>In the second part, if we have a linear combination involving the zero vector, does the value of the scalar in front of <span class="process-math">\(\zer\)</span> matter? (Can it change the value of the linear combination?) If not, is there any reason that scalar would have to be zero?</p></article></body>
