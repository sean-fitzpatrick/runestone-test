<p>Python is a very popular programming language, partly because of its ease of use. Those of you enrolled in Education may find yourself teaching Python to your students one day. Also, if you do want to use Sage, you're in luck: Sage is an amalgamation of many different software tools, including Python. So any Python code you encounter in this course can also be run on Sage. <em class="emphasis">You do not have to be a programmer</em> to run the code in this book. We'll be primarily working with the <dfn class="terminology">SymPy</dfn> Python library, which provides many easy to use functions for operations like determinant and inverse.</p>
