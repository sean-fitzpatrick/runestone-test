<p>These notes originally began as an attempt to make Python-based worksheets that could be exported from PreTeXt to Jupyter, for use in the classroom. It quickly became apparent that something more was needed, and the worksheets morphed into lecture notes. These are intended to serve as a textbook for Math 3410, but with some work they can also be used in class. The notes are written in PreTeXt, and can be converted to both Jupyter notebooks and reveal.js slides.</p>
