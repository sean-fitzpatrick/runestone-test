<p>In fact, if we replace <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(\C\text{,}\)</span> about the only thing we'd have to go back and change is the definition of the dot product. The reason for this is that although the complex numbers seem computationally more complicated, (which might mostly be because you don't use them often enough) they follow the exact same algebraic rules as the real numbers. In other words, the <em class="emphasis">arithmetic</em> might be different, but the <em class="emphasis">algebra</em> is the same. There is one key difference between the two fields: over the complex numbers, every polynomial can be factored. This is important if you're interested in finding eigenvalues.</p>
