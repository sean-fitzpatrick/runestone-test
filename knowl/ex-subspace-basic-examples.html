<p>For any vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\zer\}\)</span> is a subspace, known as the <em class="emphasis">trivial subspace</em>.</p>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(V=P(\R)\)</span> is the vector space of all polynomials, then for any natural number <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> the subset <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> Another common type of polynomial subspace is the set of all polynomials with a given root. For example, the set <span class="process-math">\(U=\{p(x)\in P(\R)\,|\,p(1)=0\}\)</span> is easily confirmed to be a subspace. However, a condition such as <span class="process-math">\(p(1)=2\)</span> would <em class="emphasis">not</em> define a subspace, since this condition is not satisfied by the zero polynomial.</p>
<p>In <span class="process-math">\(\R^n\text{,}\)</span> we can define a subspace using one or more homogeneous linear equations. For example, the set</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\{(x,y,z)\,|\, 2x-3y+4z=0\}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">is a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> A non-homogeneous equation won't work, however, since it would exclude the zero vector. Of course, we should expect that any non-linear equation fails to define a subspace, although one is still expected to verify this by confirming the failure of one of the axioms. For example, the set <span class="process-math">\(S=\{(x,y)\,|\,x=y^2\}\)</span> is not a subspace; although it contains the zero vector (since <span class="process-math">\(0^2=0\)</span>), we have <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\in S\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(2(1,1)=(2,2)\)</span> does not belong to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-subspace.html#ex-subspace-basic-examples" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
