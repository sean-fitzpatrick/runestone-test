<p>We have an “if and only” if statement, which means we have to prove two directions:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq W\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(W\subseteq U\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(U\cup W\)</span> is a subspace.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="process-math">\(U\cup W\)</span> is a subspace, then <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq W\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(W\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first direction is the easy one: if <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq W\text{,}\)</span> what can you say about <span class="process-math">\(U\cup W\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>For the other direction, it's not clear how to get started with our hypothesis. When a direct proof seems difficult, remember that we can also try proving the contrapositive: If <span class="process-math">\(U\not\subseteq W\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\not\subseteq U\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(U\cup W\)</span> is not a subspace.</p>
<p>Now we have more to work with: negation turns the “or” into an “and”, and proving that something is not a subspace is easier: we just have to show that one part of the subspace test fails. As our motivating example suggests, we should expect closure under addition to be the condition that fails.</p>
<p>To get started, we need to answer one more question: if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is not a subset of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> what does that tell us?</p>
<p>An important point to keep in mind with this proof: closure under addition means that if a subspace contains <span class="process-math">\(\uu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ww\text{,}\)</span> then it must contain <span class="process-math">\(\uu+\ww\text{.}\)</span> But if a subspace contains <span class="process-math">\(\uu+\ww\text{,}\)</span> that does <em class="emphasis">not</em> mean it has to contain <span class="process-math">\(\uu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\ww\text{.}\)</span> As an example, consider the subspace <span class="process-math">\(\{(x,x)\,|\,x\in\R\}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> It contains the vector <span class="process-math">\((1,1)=(1,0)+(0,1)\text{,}\)</span> but it does not contain <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-subspace-combine.html#proof-21" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
