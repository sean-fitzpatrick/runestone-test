<p>There are two important observations: one is that performing addition or scalar multiplication on elements of <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> produces a new element of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> The other is that this addition and multiplication is essentially that of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> The vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is just a placeholder. Addition simply involves the real number addition <span class="process-math">\(a+b\text{.}\)</span> Scalar multiplication becomes the real number multiplication <span class="process-math">\(ca\text{.}\)</span> So we expect that the rules for addition and scalar multiplication in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> follow those in <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is like a “copy” of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> inside of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span> In particular, addition and scalar multiplication in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> will satisfy all the vector space axioms, so that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> deserves to be considered a vector space in its own right.</p>
