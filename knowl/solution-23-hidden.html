<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>We need to show that the set is independent, and that it spans.</p>
<p>The set is independent if the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x(1,1,0)+y(1,0,1)+z(0,1,1)=(0,0,0)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">has <span class="process-math">\(x=y=z=0\)</span> as its only solution. This equation is equivalent to the system</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{align*}
x+y \amp =0\\
x+z \amp =0\\
y+z \amp =0\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>We know that the solution to this system is unique if the coefficient matrix <span class="process-math">\(A = \bbm 1\amp 1\amp 0\\1\amp 0\amp 1\\0\amp 1\amp 1\ebm\)</span> is invertible. Note that the columns of this matrix are vectors in our set.</p>
<p>We can determine invertibility either by showing that the <abbr class="initialism">RREF</abbr> of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is the identity, or by showing that the determinant of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is nonzero. Either way, this is most easily done by the computer:</p>
<pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-19"><script type="text/x-sage">from sympy import Matrix,init_printing
init_printing()
A = Matrix([[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1]])
A.rref(), A.det()
</script></pre>
<p>Our set of vectors is therefore linearly independent. Now, to show that it spans, we need to show that for any vector <span class="process-math">\((a,b,c)\text{,}\)</span> the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x(1,1,0)+y(1,0,1)+z(0,1,1)=(a,b,c)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">has a solution. But we know that this system has the same coefficient matrix as the one above, and that existence of a solution again follows from invertibility of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> which we have already established.</p>
<p>Note that for three vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> once independence has been confirmed, span is automatic. We will soon see that this is not a coincidence.</p>
