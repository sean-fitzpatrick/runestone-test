<p>This is a proof that would be difficult (if not impossible) without using a basis. Your first thought might be to choose bases for the subspaces <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> but this runs into trouble: some of the basis vectors for <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> might be in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Of course, those vectors will be in <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W\text{,}\)</span> but it gets hard to keep track: without more information (and we have none, since we want to be completely general), how do we tell which basis vectors are in the intersection, and how many?</p>
<p>Instead, we <em class="emphasis">start</em> with a basis for <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W\text{.}\)</span> This is useful, because <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W\)</span> is a subspace of both <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> So any basis for <span class="process-math">\(U\cap W\)</span> can be extended to a basis of <span class="process-math">\(U\text{,}\)</span> and it can also be extended to a basis of <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>The rest of the proof relies on making sure that neither of these extensions have any vectors in common, and that putting everything together gives a basis for <span class="process-math">\(U+W\text{.}\)</span> (This amounts to going back to the definition of a basis: we need to show that it's linearly independent, and that it spans <span class="process-math">\(U+W\text{.}\)</span>)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-subspace-combine.html#proof-27" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
